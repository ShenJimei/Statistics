Fiscal revenue is the sum of all funds raised by the government to perform its functions, implement public policies, and provide public goods and services. It is an important indicator of the financial strength of a country's government, provides guarantees for the performance of state functions and the national development. Accurately predicting fiscal revenue is conducive to the preparation of government budgets, reasonable arrangements for deficits, and the longest possible balance of fiscal revenue and expenditure. This paper conducts a sample survey on the public data of Liaoning Province's fiscal budget from 1984 to 2016, Comparing the total index estimated by the sample with the actual fiscal revenue, It is found that there are some differences in content and scope between the local fiscal revenue after 1994 and the local fiscal revenue under the previous total share fiscal system. In 2002, there was another major reform in the distribution of income tax income. After the financial crisis broke out in 2008, China implemented a relatively intensive active fiscal policy, resulting in vertical incomparability of historical data and inaccurate fiscal revenue budget. In order to solve this problem, this paper uses actual fiscal revenue data and introduces artificial intelligence optimization algorithms to establish a fiscal revenue forecasting model with strong timeliness and explanatory power. First, a time series analysis of the fiscal revenue data of Liaoning Province from 1985 to 2016 was conducted. It was found that the average fiscal revenue calculated by Liaoning Province between 1985 and 2016 was higher than its budget level and the national average. In general, from 1985 to 2016, fiscal revenue showed a trend of 8.8% growth in Liaoning. Then, after moving average of the fiscal revenue data from 1985 to 2016, the four components of fiscal revenue disclosure were applied to the multiple linear regression method to fit the fiscal revenue forecast curve. The results show that: state-owned capital operating income, planned losses by state-owned enterprises, budget revenues, and fiscal revenue return are not significantly related. In order to explore the influencing factors of fiscal revenue in Liaoning Province, a factor analysis method was used to obtain the principal component analysis of each segment of fiscal revenue data. Public factor 1 mainly constitutes 12 incomes such as personal income tax with the variance contribution rate is 30.947%; public factor 2 mainly constitutes 8 items of income including business tax, and the variance contribution rate is 30.924%; public factor 3 mainly consists of consumption tax and confiscated income, and the variance contribution rate is 17.892%; public factor 4 mainly includes other taxes, the contribution rate of variance is 15.061%. Dimension reduction is performed on the data according to the correlation score matrix. Take the four public factors after dimensionality reduction as input, and the actual fiscal revenue of each year as output. The training consists of 1 input layer, 2 hidden layers, and 1 output layer. The number of hidden neurons in the hidden layers 1 and 2 is 2, 1, the accuarcy is 99.46%, indicting Artificial neural network with very good prediction ability on this issue. Finally, influencing factors of fiscal revenue forecast are discussed and relevant policy suggestions to help Liaoning's economy run smoothly and healthy are put forward.
